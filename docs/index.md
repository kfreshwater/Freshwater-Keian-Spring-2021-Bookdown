# Introduction {-}

This site serves as a portfolio for R software projects conducted during Spring 2022. These projects were created during Colorado State University's 'Introduction to Data Science' graduate course, but independently serve as a representation of different learned techniques. Each of the following chapters highlight a specific R topic expressed through a real-world analysis, consisting of detailed figures, textual interpretations of the data, and commented code blocks.
