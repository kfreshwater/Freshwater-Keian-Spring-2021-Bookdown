These projects were created during Colorado State Universitys Introduction to Data Science graduate course, but independently serve as a representation of different learned techniques. Each of the following chapters highlight a specific R topic expressed through a real-world analysis, consisting of detailed figures, textual interpretations of the data, and commented code blocks.

The Poudre River is a National Heritage Area located in the state of Colorado, originally designated in 2009. The river begins in Rocky Mountain National Park, before joining with the South Platte River east of Greeley, Colorado. Over half a million residents in Northern Colorado depend on the water supplied by the Poudre River. The National Water Quality Council tracks USGS stations monitoring hydrologic conditions; on the National Water Quality Councils website, station data can be isolated from the beginning of the Poudre River, all the way to the South Plattesand resulting Plattesconjunction to the Missippi River. Looking just at Fort Collins, there are a high concentration of USGS stations along the path of the river. Fort Collins Utilities works hard to ensure that residents in the city will have clean, drinkable water; although not all water comes from tin 2020, it was estimated that facilities treat 23 million gallons of water a day. The city doesnt solely rely on the South Platte River, of course; during wildfire runoff events that increases sediment levels above capacity limits, Fort Collins relies more heavily on water from Horsetooth Reservoir.
